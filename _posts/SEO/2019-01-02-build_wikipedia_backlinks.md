Getting **backlinks** from **Wikipedia** not only helps to increase direct traffic but also gets awesome **SEO** juice to our blog. Important tactics like <a href="#dead-link-method" target="_top">dead link method</a>, broken link method or <a href="#wikipedia-backlink" target="_top">improving Wikipedia page</a> by inserting our link as a moderator by just creating an account for free helps to get everlasting **backlinks** from **Wikipedia**. Once you know how to get a backlink from Wikipedia, we can create as many links as possible but **Wikipedia** only accepts the changes that add value to their articles, Information needs to be factual, well-researched and error-free.

In here, we are talking about **building** long-lasting **Wikipedia backlinks** by inserting a **link** in Wikipedia article to somewhere on your website which needs to be a reliable source for a claim that's already been made on **Wikipedia** before. Creating backlinks at Wikipedia is an easy task by following these simple tactics which I had posted briefly in here.

There are a number of bloggers, journalists, students, and others in control of Web content who rely on some combination of Google and Wikipedia to research a topic. As Wikipedia has **no-follow links**, getting links included on a Wikipedia page may likely offer little direct ranking advantage for your site.

An important thing to note about this tactic is that not unlike many quality **link building efforts**: it requires a certain amount of time and resources, and carries with it the risk of relative or objective failure from a links building perspective. For this reason "**doing your research**" is crucial.

Not only a **genuine backlink** loved by Google, but it also drives huge **traffic** to our website, plus, once you have a link on a **Wikipedia page**, other websites will often reference you as well, generating you more backlinks organically over time. Importantly, Wikipedia only accepts the changes that add value to their articles, Information needs to be factual, well-researched and error-free.

<h2 id="what-is-backlink"><strong>1 What is a Backlink?</strong></h2>

**Backlinks** are the incoming hyperlink to a website. When a webpage links to any other webpage it is called a **backlink**. In the past, backlinks are the major metrics in the ranking of a webpage. A webpage with a lot of backlinks gets tended to rank higher in all **search engines** including Google as it plays a quite important role in Search Engine Optimization.

It is important to get **backlinks** from quality sites, and those backlinks should be contextual. For example, you have a niche site about mechanical trucks, then when you are **building backlinks** from another category niche site ( maybe about Royal Enfield Bikes ) then, these backlinks will be of no use.

<h2><strong>What is  No-Follow and Do-Follow Backlinks?</strong></h2>

<h3 id="no-follow-backlink"><strong>2. No-Follow Backlink.</strong></h3>

**No-follow links** are the links with **rel="no-follow"** HTML tag applied to them. The no-follow tag tells search engines to **ignore** that link. Because no-follow links do not pass PageRank they likely don't impact search engine rankings.

This is a link that does not count as a point in the page’s favor, does not boost PageRank, and doesn’t help a page’s placement in the SERPs. **No-follow** links get no love. Theirs is a sad and lonely life.

The only technical difference between the two is that a **no-follow** link has a **no-follow tag**. The no-follow tag is basically a notice sign for search engines saying “**don't count this.**”

An example of No-Follow link.

<pre>
<code>
&lt;a href="https://www.alltechnotricks.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karunakar Patel Blog &lt;/a&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h3 id="do-follow-backlink"><strong>3. Do-Follow Backlink.</strong></h3>

**Do-follow link** allows all the search engines including Google to follow the link and pass on to our website. These **do-follow** links are those which pass on the **SEO** benefit of the website where it is built from the hyperlinked website.

**Dofollow backlinks** created from high **PR** and high Domain Authority sources will pass on the link juices towards a hyperlinked blog. This will improve its ranking position significantly in search engines.

An example of Dofollow Link:

<pre>
<code>
&lt;a href="https://www.alltechnotricks.com"&gt; Karunakar Patel Blog.&lt;/a&gt;
</code>
</pre>

Follow these Steps to create a Wikipedia Backlink.

<h2 id="dead-link-method"><strong>4.Dead Link Method.</strong></h2>

Think that all of the sources linked in and out of the **Wikipedia pages** are considerably large in number. It is obvious that all the links are not going to be up to date in real time.

Identifying **dead links** on Wikipedia articles is an easy way to find opportunities for a Wikipedia backlink. A dead link is a link to a source on Wikipedia page that doesn't work; it brings a **404 page**.

<figure><img src="/uploads/dead-wikipedia-link.jpg" data-src="uploads/dead-wikipedia-link.jpg" alt="wikipedia-backlinks-dead-link-method" title="wikipedia-backlinks-dead-link-method" class="lazy" />
<figcaption>Wikipedia Backlinks: Dead Link Method.
</figcaption>
</figure>

By Wikipedia’s definition, a **Dead link** is used to describe a link that is no longer active. Meaning that the content that was once on the other side of the link isn’t there anymore.

This indicates to Wikipedia moderators (or anyone looking) that the link needs to be fixed or updated. **Wikipedia** is just like any other website. Because there are so many links, hundreds of them are broken and almost impossible to keep on top of in real time.

If you come across a Wikipedia page that includes a **dead link** at the end, you’re in luck — this can be a great opportunity to replace it with your own. So, your opportunity for building links here comes in the form of providing them with the content they need to fill that link. That's all.

By using the <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine tool</a>, you can check a **broken link** to see what it used to link to. If your desired link offers similar **content**, that means you have a good opportunity to replace it. You also have the option to write content based on what that link used to pull up, granted you don’t already have it. And your **content** could be just the link that they’re looking for.

<h3><strong>Use Google Search To Find Dead Links.</strong></h3>

If you would like to use **Google Search** to find an opportunity to create a **backlink** from **Wikipedia**, then head over to Google search console and type the following queries along with your particular keywords in between simple quotation marks.

<blockquote><strong>site:wikipedia.org "Keyword phrase" "dead link"</strong></blockquote>

</figure>

After finding a **Wikipedia article** based on particular keyword phrase you searched with a dead link. By clicking on that links use **ctrl + f** to find a **dead link**.

This method is just as simple, but you’ll have to do a little more work on finding the relevant pages and include with your own website link as a reference.

<h2 id="wikipedia-backlink"><strong>5. Improve Wikipedia Articles.</strong></h2>

We can improve **Wikipedia articles** as a moderator by just creating an account at **Wikipedia** for 100% free of cost. To create an account, just click on "**Create Account**" located on the top right corner of the page and the following credentials and hit the submit button.

<h3><strong>Must read before you add your links to Wikipedia.</strong></h3>

Before we start editing **Wikipedia** and updating it with our link fix there are a couple of things you need to think about.

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
	<li>If you're just throwing out a link to a site with poor quality content that has nothing to do with the required <strong>citation</strong> or <strong>dead link</strong> fix it is not going to get approved.</li>
	<li>You need to spend time (lots of it) to edit the content in <strong>Wikipedia</strong> and to help Wiki maintain its content.</li>
	<li>Do not edit <strong>content</strong> just for the sake of editing. The editing that you do must be accurate or else you may be removed as an <strong>editor</strong>.</li>
	<li>Other <strong>Wiki editors</strong> will be watching you and if they suspect any wrongdoing, they will report you.</li>
<li>Pick articles in <strong>Wiki</strong> that has the scope for you to add more details to it.</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong> studiously for information that you can provide to that page and ensure that the content is well presented.</li>
<li>You can cite reliable sources while providing information to **Wiki pages**.</li>
<li>Once you have developed a trusted history in <strong>Wiki</strong>, you can add your **links** on pages that have content that is relevant to your products or services.</li>
<li>Ensure that you provide the reason why the <strong>link</strong> you have provided will be useful.</li>
<li>Keep searching for <strong>content</strong> that is relevant to your business and sketches out plans on how you can add links to that page.</li>
<li><strong>Add links</strong> that are relevant, or it will be deleted by other <strong>editors</strong>.</li>
<li>DO NOT spam <strong>Wiki</strong> with links, as it will hurt you badly. Be **organic** and add links in a smart manner. </li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2 id="edit-wikipedia-article"><strong>6. Edit a Wikipedia Article To Get A Backlink.</strong></h2>
