The <b>Oscars 2019</b> marked the <b>91st edition</b> of the biggest night in film. It came during a monumental time in Hollywood. Always the highlight of awards season, this year’s Oscars were full of surprises - with unexpected wins in several of the major categories. Below, I share its definitive guide to the 2019 Academy Awards, from the red-carpet gowns to the tear-jerking speeches.

The <b>91st Academy Awards</b>, commonly referred to as The Oscars and presented by the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, honored the best films of 2018. The ceremony was held on February 24, 2019, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. <b>AMPAS</b> presented Academy Awards in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and produced by Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, with Weiss also serving as director. It was the first ceremony in three decades, since the 61st Academy Awards in 1989, to be conducted with <b>no host</b>.

Here are the list of the <b>official Oscar winners</b> and their details that they had won in the <b>91st Academy Awards</b>. Winning an Oscar is all well and good. Like everyone else in the world.

[Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727824/?ref_=nv_sr_1){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} is a foot-stomping celebration of <b>Queen</b>, their music and their extraordinary lead singer <b>Freddie Mercury</b>. Freddie defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved entertainers on the planet.

They reach unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn <b>Freddie</b>, surrounded by darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent <b>AIDS diagnosis</b>, <b>Freddie</b> leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy that continues to <b>inspire outsiders</b>, <b>dreamers</b> and <b>music lovers</b> to this day.
