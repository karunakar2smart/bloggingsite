<h2 id="the-blind-side"><strong>The Blind Side.</strong></h2>

<strong>Michael Oher</strong> was just 16 years old when his life changed forever. He went from living with a drug-addicted mother to becoming a professional football player in the span of a few years. Michael has one special family and a few others to thank for propelling him towards the life he lives today.

His story was documented in the Oscar-winning film [The Blind Side](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878804/?ref_=nv_sr_1){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and while the film got many things right, it also got a few things wrong — and there’s a major reason why Michael himself doesn’t like the movie.

The 2009 movie <strong>The Blind Side</strong> starred Quinton Aaron as Michael “<strong>Big Mike</strong>” Oher, a high school student at Briarcrest Christian School who was rescued from poverty and taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). Big Mike became a highly sought-after prospect in college football and wound up playing for the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens.

The film was based on the 2006 book, “<strong>The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game</strong>” by Michael Lewis and was written and directed by <strong>John Lee Hancock</strong>. The movie made $300 million at the box office, and Bullock won an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for her role.

Here is the loved quote from the film [THE BLIND SIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Side_(film)){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}."

<blockquote>"Dont Ever Allow Yourself To Feel Trapped By Your Choices. Take A Look At Yourself. You Are Unique Person Created For A Specific Purpose.
				<br> Your Gifts Matter.
				<br> Your Story Matter.
				<br> Your Dreams Matter.
				<br> You Matter. <br> <a class="w-inline-block social-share-btn tw" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?" target="_blank" title="Tweet" onclick="window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%20Hope%20Is%20A%20Good%20Thing,%20Maybe%20The%20Best%20Of%20Things,%20And%20No%20Good%20Thing%20Ever%20Dies.' + encodeURIComponent(document.title) + ':%20 ' + encodeURIComponent(document.URL)); return false;">Tweet</a></blockquote>
