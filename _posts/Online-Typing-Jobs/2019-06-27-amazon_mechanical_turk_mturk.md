<h3 id="requester"><strong>☑ Requester.</strong></h3>

A <strong>Requester</strong> is a company, organization, or person that creates and submits tasks (HITs) to Amazon Mechanical Turk for Workers to perform. As a Requester, you can use a software application to interact with Amazon Mechanical Turk to submit tasks, retrieve results, and perform other automated tasks. You can use the Requester website to check the status of your HITs and manage your account.

<h3 id="amazon-mechanical-turk-HIT"><strong>☑ What is an Amazon Mechanical Turk HIT?</strong></h3>

A <strong>Human Intelligence Task aka (HIT)</strong> is a task that a Requester submits to Amazon Mechanical Turk for Workers to perform. A HIT represents a single, self-contained task. Workers can find HITs listed on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. For more information, go to the Amazon Mechanical Turk website. Each HIT has a lifetime, specified by the Requester, that determines how long the HIT is available to Workers. A HIT also has an assignment duration, which is the amount of time a Worker has to complete a HIT after accepting it.

<h3 id="worker"><strong>☑ Worker.</strong></h3>

A <strong>Worker</strong> is a person who performs the tasks specified by a Requester in a HIT. Workers use the Amazon Mechanical Turk website to find and accept assignments, enter values into the question form, and submit the results. The Requester specifies how many Workers can work on a task. Amazon Mechanical Turkguarantees that a Worker can work on each task only one time.

<h3 id="assignment"><strong>☑ Assignment.</strong></h3>

An <strong>assignment</strong> specifies how many people can submit completed work for your HIT. When a Worker accepts a HIT, Amazon Mechanical Turk creates an assignment to track the work to completion. The assignment belongs exclusively to the Worker and guarantees that the Worker can submit results and be eligible for a reward until the time the HIT or assignment expires.

<h3 id="reward"><strong>☑ Reward.</strong></h3>

A <strong>reward</strong> is the money gained by you, as a Requester, pay Workers for satisfactory work they do on your HITs.
