<b>Mobile first indexing</b> exactly means that the mobile version of your website becomes the starting point for what Google will predominantly use the content for indexing and rankings.

In before, Google primarily used the <b>desktop version</b> of the page's content when evaluating the relevance of a page to a search query. But, the majority of users now access Google via a mobile device, the index will primarily use the <b>mobile version</b> of a page's content.

<h3 id="dynamic-serving"><strong>Dynamic Serving.</strong></h3>

<b>Dynamic serving websites</b> utilize only one URL for each device that searches for your website where all of your content is on the same URL. The difference is that you show each user different HTML/CSS depending on the device they're using.

<div class="article-image">
<img src="#" data-src="../uploads/dynamic-serving-image.png" class="lazy" alt="dynamic-serving-image" title="dynamic-serving-image" id="article_image">
</div>	

The reason for this is that depending on the device that a website visitor may be using, the experience will be different. Certain content will be shown in one place but not another.

For example, if you visit my blog <a href="https://www.alltechnotricks.com" target="_top" rel="noopener">https://www.alltechnotricks.com</a> on a desktop, you would serve with a <b>desktop version</b> of my page.

But, when you visit my blog <a href="https://www.alltechnotricks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.alltechnotricks.com</a> on any mobile device you would get shown the <b>mobile version</b> of the page having the <b>same URL</b>.

<h3 id="seperate-url"><strong>Separate URL.</strong></h3>

Using the <b>separate URLs</b> website structure, your website investigates out what device your visitor is using and then redirect either to a desktop or mobile version of the website which are built with different HTML and CSS.

<div class="article-image">
<img src="#" data-src="../uploads/separate-urls.png" class="lazy" alt="seperate-urls" title="seperate-urls" id="article_image">
</div>	

In this case, the mobile site utilizes a mobile-specific URL which is typically an m-dot, or dot-mobi, or even a separate folder.

<h2 id="mobile-on-page-seo"><strong>Mobile's On-Page SEO.</strong></h2>

<b>On-page SEO</b> is the practice of optimizing individual web pages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals.

<p id="on_page_container_p">On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals. </p>
</div>
			
If you put effort into these categories and strategies, you’ll see a boost in traffic and a rise in your search presence. Once you understand everything that goes into your <b>on-page SEO</b> efforts, conduct an analysis of your site to see how the anatomy of your page is performing.

<h3 id="use-a-viewport-tag"><strong>Use a Viewport Tag.</strong></h3>

Pages optimized for a variety of devices must include a <b>meta viewport tag</b> in the head of the document. A meta <b>viewport tag</b> gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

Without a viewport <b>meta tag</b>, mobile devices render pages at typical desktop screen widths, and then scale the pages to fit the mobile screens. Setting the <b>viewport</b> enables you to control the width and scaling of the viewport. 

<p style="border: 1px solid lightgrey; margin: auto; text-align: center; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;"> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</p>

<h5>Recommendations : -</h5>

Add a viewport <span style="background: lightgrey; border-radius: 2px;">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag in the <span style="background: lightgrey; border-radius: 2px;">&lt;head&gt;</span> of your HTML.

<p style="background: lightgrey; text-align: center; border-radius: 5px;"> &lt;head&gt;
				<br> ...
				<br> &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
				<br> ...
				<br> &lt;/head&gt;
				<br> </p>
				
The width=device-width key-value pair sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device. The initial-scale=1 key-value pair sets the initial zoom level when visiting the page.

<h3 id="let-google-crawl-everything"><strong>Let Google Crawl Everything.</strong></h3>

<b>"Crawler"</b> is a generic term for any program (such as a robot or spider) used to automatically discover and scan websites by following links from one webpage to another. Google's main crawler is called <b>Googlebot</b>.

Google and other Web search engines use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of other sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine which <b>indexes</b> the downloaded pages so users can search more efficiently.

When Google visits your website for tracking purpose, make sure that it reaches out each and every single URL, folder, every page of your website which eventually increases our ranking in <b>Mobile SEO</b>.

Before you search, site crawlers gather information from across hundreds of billions of web pages. Make sure that you submit <b>sitemap.xml</b> and <b>robots.txt</b> file perfectly without any mistakes.

<h3 id="fetch-as-google-smartphone"><strong>Fetch As Google(Smartphone)</strong></h3>

<b>Google search console</b> is a wonderful way to understand how Google and other search engines find issues and optimize your site for indexing. The great tool "<b>Fetch as Google</b>" enables you to test how <b>Google crawls</b> or <b>renders a URL</b> on your site. You can use <b>Fetch as Google</b> to see whether Googlebot can access a page on your site, how it renders the page, and whether any page resources (such as images or scripts) are blocked to <b>Googlebot</b>.

This tool simulates a crawl and render execution as done in Google's normal crawling and rendering process, and is useful for debugging crawl issues on your site. "<b>Fetch as Google</b>" is an option available for webmasters to check how a web page will be looking when Googlebot crawls that page. 

This tool can be effectively used for the following purposes:

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>Mobile friendly test can be done in Google search console as to check whether our site is mobile friendly or not. </li>
					<li>Troubleshooting web pages to improve the performance in search engine result pages.</li>
					<li>Loads quickly like mobile users expect.</li>
					<li>Submitting pages for indexing whenever the content is changed significantly. </li>
					<li>Finding out the pages causing issues when a site is hacked by malware.</li>

<h3 id="boost-mobile-speed-using-cdn"><strong>Boost Mobile Speed Using CDN.</strong></h3>

How important is your website’s loading time? Improving your site speed plays a vital role in increasing your site’s SEO score as it enhances the user’s experience and boosts your site’s conversion rate.

A study conducted by MOZ says if your website’s loading time is more than 5s, 75% other sites will be faster than your site and most users won’t be so willing to wait. Instead, they would just leave your site. 

Using a <b>Content delivery network (CDN)</b> is the best approach to increase site speed. CDNs are designed to reduce a website’s <b>latency</b>. Latency is nothing but the time taken to process a user’s request to view your site, from the instance it is made to the moment when the content actually appears on the user’s browser. 

<div class="article-image">
<img src="#" data-src="../uploads/cdn-image.png" class="lazy" alt="cdn-image" title="cdn-image" id="article_image">
</div>	

Many largest internet firms like <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix</a> etc use CDNs. <b>CDNs</b> serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics, and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social media sites.

<b>Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</b> serve the content of a site to a user based on their geographic location, through their “<b>Distributed Data Centers</b>” that are available across the globe. The goal is to provide high availability and high performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. 

So, I recommend using a CDN to increase site loading speed.

<h3 id="amp"><strong>Accelerated Mobile Pages(AMP).</strong></h3>

<b>Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP</b> is an open source coding standard for publishers which were stripped down versions of web pages designed and optimized for mobile devices. Simply, It's like taking a page that is already <b>mobile friendly</b> and making it load quicker on mobile devices.

The best part of <b>AMP</b> in <b>mobile SEO</b> has been speculated to have two benefits in SEO. One is it will have a "<b>FAST</b>" label designation on search engine results pages, and the other is that it will be a ranking factor. Putting higher rankings aside. Google also shows a little icon next to your result in the search results that may boost your <b>CTR</b>.

<h3 id="image-optimization"><strong>Image Optimization.</strong></h3>

Whenever you are writing articles online, chances are you'll find yourself asking whether your article needs an image or not. The answer is always "YES". <b>Images</b> bring an article to <b>life</b> and can also contribute to your <b>website's SEO</b>.

It’s a simple recommendation: you should add images to every article you write online to make them more appealing. What’s more, since visual search is getting increasingly important — as seen in <b>Google’s vision</b> for the future of search — it could turn out to provide you with a nice bit of traffic. If you have visual content it might make sense to put <b>image SEO</b> a bit higher on your to-do list.

This post explains how to fully optimize an image for <b>SEO</b> and provides some pointers on using images for the best user experience. Once you have found the right image – whether an illustration, chart or photo – the next step is to optimize it for use on your website. 

There are a number of things you need to think about:

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>Reduce file size for faster page load speed.</li>
					<li>JPEGs are generally the best option for website photos.</li>
					<li>Never use GIFs for large product images.</li>
					<li>Make sure the image is relative to the page.</li>
					<li>For crawlability, create an image sitemap.</li>
					<li>Improve stock images with tools like Canva.</li>
					<li>Create OG and Twitter Cards for social shares.</li>
					<li>Make sure the image has google title tags and file names.</li>
					<li>Do not overstuff keywords in alt text, make sure it describes the photo.</li>
				</ol>

<p>One of the most important recommended tip by Google in image optimization is to use lazy loading images on your websites.</p>
</div>

<b>Lazy Loading</b> defers the loading of an image that is not needed on the page immediately. An image that is not visible to the user when the <b>page loads</b>, is loaded later when the user scrolls and the image actually become visible. If the user never scrolls, an image that is not visible to the user never gets loaded.

<div class="article-image">
<img src="#" data-src="../uploads/lazy-loading-image-sample.png" class="lazy" alt="lazy-loading-image" title="lazy-loading-image" id="article_image">
</div>	

These techniques help in improving performance, better utilization of the device’s resources and reducing associated costs.

Here are some best practises

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>Use correct canonical tags.</li>
					<li>Use of href lang's.</li>
					<li>Use better colors and correct font styles with good font sizes.</li>
				</ol>

<h2 id="mobile-off-page-seo"><strong>Mobile Off-Page SEO.</strong></h2>

<b>"Off-page SEO"</b> (also called "off-site SEO") refers to actions taken outside of your own website to improve the position of a website within search engine results pages (SERPs).

<div class="on_page_container">
<h2>Off-Page SEO.</h2>
<p id="on_page_container_p">"Off-page SEO" (also called "off-site SEO") refers to actions taken outside of your own website to improve the position of a website within search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
</div>

Optimizing for <b>off-site</b> ranking factors involves improving search engine and user perception of a site's popularity, relevance, trustworthiness, and authority. This is accomplished by other reputable places on the Internet (pages, sites, people, etc.) linking to or promoting your website, and effectively "affirming" for the quality of your content.

<h3 id="optimize-title-tags"><strong>Optimize Title Tags :</strong></h3>

A <b>title tag</b> is an HTML element that specifies the title of a web page. Title tags are displayed on search engine results pages (SERPs) as the clickable headline for a given result and are important for usability, <b>SEO</b>, and social sharing. The title tag of a web page is meant to be an accurate and concise description of a page's content.

When writing title tags:

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>The title must be highly relevant to the content found on that specific page.</li>
					<li>Place important keywords and phrases close to the front of the title tag so they catch the eye.</li>
					<li><b>Write naturally</b> for visitors and avoid keyword stuffing.</li>
					<li>Avoid duplication. Each page will have a different topic so it needs to have a unique title.</li>
					<li>Potentially include your brand name at the end of the title tag, but focus on getting your message across first.</li>
					<li>Keep it between 60 and 64 characters or as many characters as you can fit into a 512-pixel display. If you write a title that’s longer than that, it’ll get cut off, showing an ellipsis “….”.</li>
					<li>Make it compelling. Your title tag should be appealing enough to entice visitors to click to find out more about what you have to offer.</li>
				</ol>

<h3 id="meta-description"><strong>Meta Description:</strong></h3>

<b>Meta tags</b> are snippets of text that describe a page’s content; the meta tags don’t appear on the page itself, but only in the page’s code. We all know tags from blog culture, and meta tags are more or less the same thing, little content descriptors that help tell <b>search engines</b> what a web page is about.

The description tag is intended to be a short summary of the content found on the web page. While the <b>title tag</b> is very limited, a <b>meta description</b> gives you a bit more space to tell users what you’re offering, and it’s an opportunity to give them a compelling reason to click through to your page.

When writing meta descriptions:

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>Have unique descriptions for every page on your site.</li>
					<li>Create a compelling description using relevant keywords. Make sure what’s described is what the searcher will get.</li>
					<li>Inspire curiosity. Provide just enough information to explain what the page is about but not so much that it ruins the curiosity factor.</li>
					<li>Include a call to action within your meta description to give your reader a clear instruction of what action to take and what’s in it for them.</li>
					<li>Keep your meta descriptions between 150 and 154 characters. If they’re too long, search engines will cut off the extra characters.</li>
				</ol>

<h3 id="backlink-strategy"><strong>Backlink Strategy:</strong></h3>

<b>Backlinks</b> also called "<b>inbound links</b>" or "<b>incoming links</b>," are created when one website links to another. The link to an external website is called a backlink.

Backlinks are especially valuable for <b>SEO</b> because they represent a "vote of confidence" from one site to another.

In essence, backlinks to your website are a signal to search engines that others vouch for your content. If many sites link to the same webpage or website, search engines can infer that content is worth linking to, and therefore also worth surfacing on a SERP. So, earning these <b>backlinks</b> can have a positive effect on a site's ranking position or search visibility.

Here are some of the key backlink tactics to improve your website rankings in <b>mobile SEO</b>.

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li><b>Link Juice</b>: When a webpage links to any of your articles or your website’s homepage, it passes “link juice”. This link juice helps with the ranking of the article, and also improves the domain authority. As a blogger, you can stop passing link juice by using a no-follow tag.</li>
					<li><b>No-Follow Link</b>: When a website links to another website, but the link has a no-follow tag, that link does not pass link juice. No-follow links are not useful concerning the ranking of a page as they do not contribute anything. In general, a webmaster uses the no-follow tag when he/she is linking out to an unreliable site.</li>
					<li><b>Do-Follow Link</b>: By default, all the links that you add to a blog post are do-follow links and these pass link juice.</li>
					<li><b>Linking Root Domains</b>: This refers to the number of backlinks coming into your website from a unique domain. Even if a website has linked to your website ten times, it will only be considered as one linked root domain.</li>
					<li><b>Low-Quality Links</b>: Low-quality links are links that come from harvested sites, automated sites, spam sites, or even porn sites. Such links do far more harm than good. This is one reason you should be careful when buying backlinks.</li>
					<li><b>Internal Links</b>: Links that are going from one page to another within the same domain are called internal links. The process itself is referred to as internal linking or interlinking.</li>
					<li><b>Anchor Text</b>: Text that is used for hyperlinks is called anchor text. Anchor text backlinks work great when you are trying to rank for particular keywords.</li>
				</ol>

Your <b>content</b> can take many forms, and it can be discovered and consumed in numerous ways. It shouldn’t be your goal to write 2,000 words on a blog post because that seems like the "<b>perfect length</b>" to rank well in organic search.

If you're worried about hitting an ideal blog post length for SEO, then you’re missing the point entirely.

Your goal should be to supply the best, most useful (and optimized) version of content for your target audience that matches their intent. Your audience will appreciate it – and your website analytics will reflect that.

It shouldn’t be your goal to write 2,000 words on a blog post because that seems like the "<b>perfect length</b>" to rank well in organic search.

“<b>Make your content short and bite-sized! With all of the distractions that surround us nowadays, the average attention span is shorter than that of a goldfish!</b>”

We're here to tell you that mentality needs to be flushed down the toilet. Immediately.

In fact, long-form content has proven to be more engaging, more shareable, and better for <b>SEO</b>.

But alas, it’s not good enough these days to write 2,000 words and call it a day—and most content marketers don’t even come close to creating content that long.

<h3 id="url-structure-to-rank-in-mobile-seo"><strong>URL structure to rank in Mobile SEO.</strong></h3>

<b>SEO friendly URLs</b> are clean, relevant and easy to understand the addresses of pages on your website, and the destination you see in the browser address bar on most modern browsers. A well-crafted <b>URL</b> provides both humans and search engines an easy to understand indication fo the destination page will be about.

Here are some of the Moz recommended URL parameter structure which eventually helps in ranking <b>mobile SEO</b>.

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li>Keeping URLs as simple, relevant, compelling, and accurate as possible is key to getting both your users and search engines to understand them (a prerequisite to ranking well). Although URLs can include ID numbers and codes, the best practice is to use words that people can comprehend.</li>
					<li>URLs should be definitive but concise. By seeing only the URL, a user (and search engine!) should have a good idea of what to expect on the page.</li>
					<li>When necessary for readability, use hyphens to separate words. URLs should not use underscores, spaces, or any other characters to separate words.</li>
					<li>Use lowercase letters. In some cases, uppercase letters can cause issues with duplicate pages. For example, moz.com/Blog and moz.com/blog might be seen as two distinct URLs, which might create issues with duplicate content.</li>
					<li>Avoid the use of URL parameters, if possible, as they can create issues with tracking and duplicate content. If parameters need to be used (UTM codes, e.g.), use them sparingly.</li>

<h3 id="xml-sitemap-in-mobile-seo"><strong>XML Sitemap in Mobile SEO.</strong></h3>

A <b>sitemap</b> is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read this file to more intelligently crawl your site. A sitemap tells the crawler which files you think are important in your site and also provides valuable information about these files.

It comes in opposition to <b>robots.txt</b> files that are an exclusion protocol as it tells search engines what not to crawl. This protocol helps Google and other main search engines to easily understand your website structure while crawling it. 

In simple terms, an <b>XML sitemap</b> is a list of your website’s URLs. It acts as a roadmap to tell search engines what content is available and how to reach it and update the search results according to its <b>last modified date</b> and <b>timings</b>.

<h3 id="robots.txt-file"><strong>Robots.txt File</strong></h3>

A <b>robots.txt</b> is a text file that resides in the root directory of your website and gives search engines crawlers instructions as to which pages they can crawl and index, during the crawling and indexing process.
			
When Search engines visit your website, the first thing they do is to look for and check the contents of the <b>robots.txt</b> file. Depending on the rules specified in the file, they create a list of the URLs they can crawl and later index for the particular website.
			
Here is the best image which guides to how to use <b>disallow</b> and <b>allow tags</b> in Robots.txt file.

					<li>User-agent: The specific web crawler to which you’re giving crawl instructions (usually a search engine). A list of most user agents can be found here.</li>
					<li>Disallow: The command used to tell a user-agent not to crawl particular URL. Only one "Disallow:" line is allowed for each URL.</li>
					<li>Allow (Only applicable for Googlebot): The command to tell Googlebot it can access a page or subfolder even though its parent page or subfolder may be disallowed.</li>
					<li>Crawl-delay: How many seconds a crawler should wait before loading and crawling page content. Note that Googlebot does not acknowledge this command, but crawl rate can be set in Google Search Console.</li>

<h3 id="make-user-friendly-404-pages"><strong>Make User-friendly 404 Pages.</strong></h3>

A <b>404 page</b>, or <b>error page</b>, is the content a user sees when they try to reach a non-existent page on our website. It’s the page your server displays when it can’t find the URL requested by the user.

Whether it’s because someone has mistyped your URL or you forgot to change an old link, at some point, one of your prospective customers is going to land on a <b>404 error page</b>.

The <b>404 pages</b> are rarely given the consideration and importance it deserves. There are many different considerations that, if neglected, could have a significant negative effect on the performance of your site.

Links on <b>404 pages</b> are so important because they give users a way out of the error page. Instead of closing the window or navigating away from your site, the user is able to find helpful and potentially relevant resources on another page.

Making users getting away from your website, you may <b>redirect 404 pages</b> to your popular blog posts or your home page, or a way for users to report a broken link or a contact page/form.

You can also help your users by adding a site <b>search bar</b> to your 404 pages to allow them to find what they’re looking for directly from that page.

<h3 id="https-and-ssl"><strong>Check on HTTPS headers and SSL certificate.</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>HTTPS</strong></h4>

<b>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</b> is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's computer and the site. Users expect a secure and private online experience when using a website. We encourage you to adopt <b>HTTPS</b> in order to protect your users' connections to your website, regardless of the content on the site.

It should be a surprise to nobody that <b>Google</b> favors websites that are <b>trusted</b>, <b>secure</b>, and <b>certified</b>. This is because users can know that the website will encrypt their information for the added level of security. But users should understand that getting a certificate can be quite an involved process, which is why it allows for higher ranking benefits. Not just anyone can have a certificate for their website.

<h4><strong>SSL</strong></h4>

<b>SSL (Secure Socket Layer)</b> is the standard security technology for establishing an <b>encrypted link</b> between a web server and a browser. This secure link ensures that all data transferred remains private. It’s also called TLS (Transport Layer Security). Millions of websites use SSL encryption every day to secure connections and keep their customer’s data safe from monitoring and tampering.

An <b>SSL Certificate</b> is a block of code when a browser makes contact with a secure web site, the SSL certificate will enable an encrypted (secure) connection. It is like sealing a package before putting it in the mail. SSL certificates bring trust because each of them will contain identification information—when an SSL certificate is requested, a third party will verify the information of the organization and will then issue a unique certificate to the user with that information. This is called the authentication process, and chances are, you have encountered an error message that included the phrase.

Every website on the Internet should have an SSL certificate and be served over HTTPS. Here’s why:

<div class="article_inside_links">
<ol>
					<li><b>Performance</b>: Modern SSL can actually improve page load times.</li>
					<li><b>Search Ranking Boost</b>: Search engines favor HTTPS websites.</li>
					<li><b>Security</b>: Encrypting traffic with SSL ensures nobody can snoop on your users’ data.</li>
					<li><b>Trust</b>: By displaying a green lock in the browser’s address bar, SSL increases visitor’s trust.</li>
					<li><b>Regulatory Compliance</b>: SSL is a key component in PCI compliance.</li>

<h3 id="testmysite"><strong>TestMySite.</strong></h3>

You can use the mobile site tester on the <b>PageSpeed Insights tool</b>, but Google released an updated, more accurate version of this.

Head over to <b>Test My Site</b> to try it. Input your website URL and hit enter: Google will take a few minutes to run this report, but it will give you a detailed look at how your mobile site performs compared to industry standards.

It will even tell you how many visitors you could be losing because of lower page speed and many more recommendations to <b>optimize your mobile site</b>.

<h3 id="gtmetrix"><strong>GT Metrix.</strong></h3>

<b>GTmetrix speed test tool</b> works a little better and what all the charts mean can help you make a more data-driven decision when it comes to performance. A waterfall analysis as we call it is crucial to know how your individual assets load. 

And remember, when it comes to comparing it with Pingdom, Google PageSpeed Insights, TestMySite, Webpagetest etc... they are different tools and so it is better to stick with one or the other as they calculate things differently.

Always stay in the safe zone as it appears in the animation above.

With the advent of <b>mobile-first indexing</b>, <b>mobile SEO</b> had become something that businesses can’t afford to ignore.

When you are optimizing a website for mobile, you should keep users in the mind. Mobile SEO is all about user experience.

Optimizing content for mobile devices, taking care of technical mobile SEO (site speed, flash, AMP, technical errors), and optimizing a mobile site for awesome user experience are surefire ways to optimize a site for mobile devices and boost conversions.

Also, you should avoid making common <b>mobile SEO</b> mistakes that can kill mobile ranking and conversions.

What about you? Do you want to share any secret tip for mobile SEO in 2019? Do share it in the comment section. I’d love to know about it.
