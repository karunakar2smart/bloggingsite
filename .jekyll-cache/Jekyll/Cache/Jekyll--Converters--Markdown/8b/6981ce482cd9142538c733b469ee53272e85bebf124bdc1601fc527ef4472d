<h2 id="sanju"><strong>SANJU.</strong></h2>

<p>Few lives in our times are as dramatic and enigmatic as the saga of <strong>Sanjay Dutt</strong>. Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of diehard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanju" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">Sanju</a> is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “<strong>did this really happen?</strong>” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">The Shawshank Redemption</a> tells the story of a banker named <strong>Andy Dufresne</strong>, who is wrongfully handed a life sentence for murdering his wife and her lover. This is widely considered to be one of the <strong>greatest movies</strong> of all time, and rightly so.</p>

<p>Andy goes on to use his financial skills to help the warden and the prison guards to keep accounts. These include the gains they’ve been making from illegally using prisoners as manual labor, which is brutally exposed by Andy eventually.</p>

<p>The film illustrates the need to develop long-term goals while continuing to fulfill short-term goals. While keeping the guards and warden placated was the short-term goal for Andy, the ultimate goal was his freedom.</p>

<h2 id="the-blind-side"><strong>The Blind Side.</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Michael Oher</strong> was just 16 years old when his life changed forever. He went from living with a drug-addicted mother to becoming a professional football player in the span of a few years. Michael has one special family and a few others to thank for propelling him towards the life he lives today.</p>

<p>His story was documented in the Oscar-winning film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878804/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">The Blind Side</a> and while the film got many things right, it also got a few things wrong — and there’s a major reason why Michael himself doesn’t like the movie.</p>

<p>The 2009 movie <strong>The Blind Side</strong> starred Quinton Aaron as Michael “<strong>Big Mike</strong>” Oher, a high school student at Briarcrest Christian School who was rescued from poverty and taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). Big Mike became a highly sought-after prospect in college football and wound up playing for the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens.</p>

<p>The film was based on the 2006 book, “<strong>The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game</strong>” by Michael Lewis and was written and directed by <strong>John Lee Hancock</strong>. The movie made $300 million at the box office, and Bullock won an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for her role.</p>

<p>Here is the loved quote from the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Side_(film)" target="\_blank" rel="noopener">THE BLIND SIDE</a>.”</p>

<blockquote>"Dont Ever Allow Yourself To Feel Trapped By Your Choices. Take A Look At Yourself. You Are Unique Person Created For A Specific Purpose.

				<br /> Your Story Matter.
				<br /> Your Dreams Matter.
