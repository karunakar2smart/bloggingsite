<p>Hi, guys, are you really searching for <strong>free online typing jobs</strong> and get paid on weekly basis without paying any registration fee or any investment? Yes, you are in a good place, in this article I am going to explain all the prerequisites to get into these jobs in detail. You donâ€™t need any college degree or any experience, all you need to have a good typing speed and minimum knowledge of the English language.</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely, all these <strong>online typing jobs</strong> are 100% legitimate and free to sign up for. Moreover, I personally got paid by doing these typing jobs in my spare time. Guys, the internet has opened many doors to get a job and make money by just typing online. But, what we worry about is that are these online typing jobs are legitimate? Can we trust them? What happens if we work day and night and not get paid?</p>

<p>I can understand all these doubts are buzzing in your mind. But donâ€™t worry I will guide you to the most trusted online typing jobs which I personally prefer doing these jobs and get paid with no issues. I will guide you through each and every single step in order to get into this job without any experience and get paid.</p>

<p>Guys, all you need is to have a <strong>minimum typing speed</strong> and a minimum knowledge of the English language. That is, you can get signup instantly, and start working from home without any doubt in your head.</p>

<p>I bet, that you had gone through different kinds of websites or companies who offer the same <strong>typing jobs</strong> to work from home by paying some registration fee and worked day and night and lastly not get paid. I did the same thing as you did, I personally got scammed by some companies available online.</p>

<p>Seriously, I will explain to you my experience with one company is that I paid some amount of money in the form of the registration fee as they mentioned on their website. They received their money and the feedback or customer service was very good till then. They sent me a zip file that consists of 100 images of handwritten text where I need to type in MS Word in less than a week. The payout role depends on the accuracy we type. Finally, I got busted even though I sent my work as they say that my accuracy was very low. Thatâ€™s it, I lost my money and wasted my valuable time.</p>

<p>Guys, you donâ€™t do the same mistake that I have done earlier, but no worries, I am going to explain each and every single step to get into these <strong>jobs</strong> and get your payment without any delay by just working from home. Ok, letâ€™s get started.</p>

<p>All the typing job we are talking about is that we can work <strong>online</strong> and offline. But I would personally recommend you to go through online typing jobs first. Just because we can work from anywhere at any time and at any place all over the globe. <strong>Online typing jobs</strong> are much more flexible to work rather than offline typing jobs moreover the payments are very well get received by working with these online typing jobs.</p>

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; padding: 25px 0px;">
	<script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
	<!-- Responsive ads [ text + display ] = Default == 2 --><ins class="adsbygoogle karna_g_ads" style="display:inline-block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2687924945894784" data-ad-slot="1586149574"></ins>
	<script>
		(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
	</script>
</div>

<p>Before getting into these online jobs, letâ€™s talk about the prerequisites required to do these online jobs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A computer or pc with minimum internet speed.</li>
  <li>An average typing speed. No worries if you are a beginner, if you have a strong will to learn it only takes one week to master typing.</li>
  <li>A PayPal account to receive payments. If you donâ€™t have it, let just signup it is as easy as creating a Gmail account.</li>
  <li>Minimum knowledge of the English language.</li>
  <li>A strong will to work confidently.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had gone through all these prerequisites, then let dive into the <strong>online typing jobs</strong>.</p>

<p>As there are many kinds of typing jobs available online, I would prefer to work with online captcha typing jobs. You need to type a captcha within their given interval of time. You earn for every correct input and vice-versa. All these sound confusing right? Letâ€™s first learn about <strong>captcha</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-captcha">What is a captcha?</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered when filling an online registration form, you need to type a combination of 3 or 4 letters or words before you click on the submit button? Yes, that is called a <strong>captcha</strong>. A captcha is a computer software mechanism which differentiates human from computer bots. It helps to filter out the online bots filling up the form from humans. Exactly only humans can solve the captcha but not computer bots.</p>

<p>Thank god you have reached here, I think that you got some confidence in me. Let get started with <strong>online captcha typing jobs</strong> thenâ€¦</p>

<p>These <strong>online captcha typing jobs</strong> are very much easier than any other typing jobs available on the internet. All you need is to type a captcha within a given interval of time. I really got paid by these captcha typing companies many times. As there are many companies offering online captcha <strong>typing jobs</strong>, I would sort out them by my trust in them.</p>

<p>As far as I concern, these are only the <strong>online typing jobs</strong> that I found legitimately available on the internet. Check out any one online job and play around, as I personally recommend you to join in these <strong>online typing jobs</strong>.</p>

<p>I gathered and explained all the online typing jobs which look <strong>legitimate</strong> till now, then letâ€™s talk about offline typing jobs that are available online and my experience with these typing jobs. There are many sites that offer offline typing jobs that sound may be interesting with their glamorous website design and their customer service.</p>

<p>What exactly we need to do with an <strong>offline typing job</strong> is that we need to type 100 images that were written in handwriting into an <strong>editable document</strong> i.e. in <strong>MS-word</strong>. We need to complete all those 100 jpg images into an editable document in less than a week.</p>

<p>You may find these kinds of <strong>offline typing jobs</strong> on any freelancer website. You just need to sign up and you may find different kinds of projects regarding these offline typing jobs. Select any one and place a bid for the project and start working as soon as the proposal has been accepted by your project manager. Here are some of the top freelancing websites where you can find this <strong>offline typing</strong> or <strong>ms-word typing jobs</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/ab/account-security/login?redir=%2Fsignup%2Fhome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Upwork</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Fiverr</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.simplyhired.co.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SimplyHired</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WeWorkRemotely.</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PeoplePerHour.</strong></a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.taskrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TaskRabbit.</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>You may find any <strong>offline typing job</strong> on any of these websites. But, what exactly happens is for some jobs you need to pay some amount of money for registration right away. Let me explain my bad experience with one kind of offline typing job. I came across a platform where there too many offline typing jobs available for every beginner. I trusted the platform with their best web design and their pre-made testimonials displayed on the website.</p>

<p>I trusted and paid some amount of money as <strong>registration</strong> for one project. I need to type at least 100 jpeg images which were written in handwritten notes into an editable document i.e. in MS-word. The payment depends on the <strong>accuracy</strong> of the typing. I started typing as soon as the project has been issued to me. I really worked very hard and submitted my project in time even I was very tired.</p>

<p>After two days, I got an email that says that your accuracy has been very <strong>low</strong> so you cannot get any <strong>payment</strong>. They attached a document where I had done a mistake and the calculations of my accuracy. Seriously, I just missed only four commas on the first page of 100 images and I lost accuracy.</p>

<p>What I am going to tell is that no human being can <strong>convert</strong> 100 jpeg handwritten images to a <strong>word document</strong> in less than a week without any mistakes. Yes if you do mistakes you may lose your registration fee also. So please think twice before you get into these typing jobs.</p>

<p>I honestly, prefer doing the above <strong>online typing jobs</strong> rather than offline typing jobs where you get your payment on a weekly basis. I personally gone through these online typing jobs and I think that I had put much amount of information required for you to start from the beginning. I will leave the final decision in your hands. Good luck guys.</p>
